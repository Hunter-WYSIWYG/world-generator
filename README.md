# Master's Thesis: "Procedural Generation of Open Game Worlds"

This project represents the master's thesis of Marcus Gagelmann at the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences and the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg. The repository contains the code and the corresponding paper for a prototype that procedurally generates 3D worlds with terrain, biomes, textures, vegetation and settlements. These different aspects of the worlds are highly customizable by the user. Further improved versions of these worlds could, for example, be used as the environment in video games or as a background for movies.

## Previous Work

The input meshes are generated by a terrain generator software, which was implemented as part of the course ["Interactive Media Project 1"](https://github.com/mgagel/terrain-generator "Interactive Media Project 1") at the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences.

The used biome maps are generated by a prototype, which was implemented as part of the course ["Interactive Media Project 2"](https://github.com/mgagel/biome-generator "Interactive Media Project 2") at the Anhalt University of Applied Sciences.

## How to use

The "world-generator" directory contains a Unity project that can be imported. By starting the runtime engine inside Unity, a standard terrain with textured biomes will be created by default. The user can adjust different parameters of the following components to alter the results:
 * TerrainGenerator
 * BiomeGenerator
 * PrefabGenerator
 * VillageGenerator

The user has to click the "updatePrefabs" checkbox of the PrefabGenerator to generate vegetation. To generate a settlement with it, the user has to generate a village map by clicking the updateVillageMap checkbox of the VillageGenerator before updating the prefabs.

## Technologies

* C#
* Unity 2021.1.7f1
* LaTeX

## Result Preview

In this section, some screenshots of the project results are displayed. The used textures and prefabs are placeholders to visualize where users can insert the assets required for their specific needs. Take a look at the corresponding paper at Masterarbeit/Gagelmann_Masterarbeit_final.pdf for detailed information about the project. Currently, the paper is only available in German, though.
